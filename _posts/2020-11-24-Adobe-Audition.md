2. From the Channels menu, select Mono, Stereo, or 5.1.
3. Click Ok
4. Right-click on track
5. Select Insert into Multitrack > New Multitrack session

## Save sections of a long audio file into separate files

1. Open an audio file into the Edit view of Audition
2. From the Window menu, select > Marker List to open the Markers Panel.
3. Select a section of audio that you would like to export as its own file.
4. click the “Add Marker” button in the Markers Panel.
5. When you are done marking each section, go to the Markers Panel and give each marker its own name (Label) or leave them with the default generic marker labels.
6. Select the marker ranges you wish to export (CTRL or SHIFT + click each marker).
7. Click the “Batch Export Marker Regions” button which is at the bottom of the Markers Panel with a floppy disk icon. If this button is disabled it means you either do not have any markers selected or you have individual point markers chosen and not ranges (range markers will always have a begin and end time).
