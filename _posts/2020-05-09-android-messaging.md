# Enable WiFi text messaging on Android

If you keep getting, "Setting up" and "Trying to verify" when enabling Wi-Fi text messaging, try this:

1. Turn on Airplane mode.
2. Open the Settings app.
3. Tap Apps & notifications. If you don't see all your apps, first tap See all apps or App info.
4. At the top right, tap More More and then Show system.
5. Tap Carrier Services.
6. Tap Force stop and then Ok.
7. Tap Storage and then Clear data.
8. Go back to the "App info" screen.
- Tap Messages.
- Tap Force stop and then Ok.
- Tap Storage and then Clear data.
- Turn off Airplane mode.

I still don't get free text messages on Wi-Fi when communicating with iPhone users, though.

The Messages app uses RCS (Rich Communication Services) instead of SMS as of late 2019.
