## Good

You don't lose your stake.

## Bad

You have to check if you won

You must claim prizes within 60 days.
Otherwise they will expire and you will not be able to claim them.

## Get Wallet

1. Visit https://pooltogether.com
2. Click "Start saving & winning"
3. Choose a network: Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche (All networks deposit into the same prize pool and have the same chances of winning prizes.)
4.   Estimated network fees
5.      Ethereum: $144.95
6.      Avalanche: $4.30
7.      Polygon: $0.05
8. Click "Connect wallet"
9. Select a Wallet (I will use Coinbase Wallet)

Note: Data Saver must be turned off.
