# How to Test a Car Battery With a Multimeter ( Voltage + Cold Cranking Amps)

## How to test a car battery with a multimeter

### Measures voltage to determine the battery's state of charge

1. Turn headlights on for at least 30 secs (to remove any battery surface charge)
2. On multimeter, turn dial to 20 DC Volts
3. Connect the red lead from "COM" to the positive battery terminal
4. Connect the black lead from "V" to the negative battery terminal
5. If the battery is 12.6 V or above, it's fully charged.
  - 12.7 V = 100%
  - 12.4 V = 75%
  - 12.2 V = 50%
  - 12.0 V = 25%
  - 11.9 V = Discharged

If you can start the car, let the engine run for 10 mins so the alternator can charge the battery.

### Measures how much current it can put out (in cold cranking amps).
Only test on a fully charged battery,
