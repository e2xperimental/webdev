# How to fix Apache 403 forbidden errors

Check that:

- Apache can physically access the file (the user that run apache, probably www-data or apache, can access the file in the filesystem)
- Apache can list the content of the folder (read permission)
- Apache has a "Allow" directive for that folder. There should be one for /var/www/, you can check default vhost for example.

Additionally, you can look at the error.log file (usually located at /var/log/apache2/error.log) which will describe why you get the 403 error exactly.
